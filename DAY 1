Q. Find the largest element in an array.

Solution:
To find the largest number in an array, I simply keep track largest variable value,
I go through the array one time.
If I find a number bigger than the current largest,
then the new number becomes the largest.
By the end of the loop, the largest variable contains the answer.

Code:
class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] num={6, 3, 5, 1, 9, 2, 3, 4, 0};

        int maxNum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < num.length; i++) {

             if (num[i] > maxNum) {
                 maxNum = num[i];
            }

        }

        System.out.print("Largest element in an array : " + maxNum);
    }
}

Q. Find the second largest element in an array.

Solution: 
To find the second largest number in an array, I simply keep track of two values:
The largest number
The second largest number
I go through the array one time.
If I find a number bigger than the current largest,
then the old largest becomes the second largest,
and the new number becomes the largest.
If the number is not the largest but is bigger than the second largest,
I update the second largest.
By the end of the loop, the second largest variable contains the answer.

Code:
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] num = {6, 3, 5, 1, 9, 2, 3, 4, 0, 7};

        int max1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int max2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int n : num) {
            if (n > max1) {
                max2 = max1;
                max1 = n;
            } else if (n > max2 && n != max1) {
                max2 = n;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Second largest element: " + max2);
    }
}

Q. Check if an array is sorted.

solution: To check if an array is sorted,
I go through the array from start to end and compare each element with the next one.
If every element is less than or equal to the next element, the array is sorted.
But if I find even one element that is greater than the next one,
I can immediately say the array is not sorted.

code:
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = {0, 1, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8, 10};
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i+1]) {
                System.out.print("not sorted");
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.print("Sorted");
    }
}
