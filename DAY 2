Q. Remove duplicates from a sorted array

Solution:To remove duplicates from a sorted array,
I go through the array one element at a time.
I keep track of the last unique element I saw. Since the array is already sorted,
all repeated elements come together. So, if the current element is the same as the last one,
I skip it. If it’s different, I keep it. By doing this until the end,
I get an array that has only unique elements.

Code:
 class main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = {1, 1, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8, 10, 10,11,11};
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr[i+1]) {
                continue;
            }
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.print(arr[arr.length-1]);
    }
}

Explaination: To avoid an index-out-of-bounds error, I only iterate the array up to the second-last element.
Inside the loop, I compare each element with the next one. If the two values are different,
that means the current value is unique, so I print it.
After the loop finishes, I separately print the last element of the array,
because it isn’t compared inside the loop. This ensures that the final value is always included in the output,
whether it is unique or repeated

Q. Reverse an array

Solution: To reverse an array, I don’t need to sort it.
I just start from the last element and move backward toward the first element.
By printing the elements from the end to the beginning, the array gets reversed.

code:
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = {10, 5, 6, 8, 9, 0};
        for (int i = arr.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}

Q. Count frequency of elements

Solution: To count the frequency of each element in a sorted array,
I iterate through the array only once. Since the array is already sorted, all duplicate elements appear next to each other.
I start by initializing a count variable with 1 for the current element. As I move through the array,
if the current element is the same as the next one, I simply increase the count. If the next element is different,
it means that the duplicate group has ended, so I print the element along with its count and reset the count back to 1.
After the loop ends, I also print the last element and its count because it will not be printed inside the loop

Code:
class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7};
        int count = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr[i+1]) {
                count++;
            }else {
                System.out.println(arr[i] + " " + count);
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        System.out.print(arr[arr.length-1] + " " + count);
    }
}
