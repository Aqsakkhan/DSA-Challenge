Q. Find the missing number (1 to N).

Solution: To find a missing number in a sequence,
I use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers:
n × (n + 1) / 2.
Since one number is missing, I first calculate what the total sum should be. To do this,
I take the array length and add 1 to get n, because one value is absent from the sequence.
Then I compute the actual sum of all the numbers present in the array.
Finally, the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum gives me the missing number.

Code:
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6};
        int n = arr.length + 1;
        int num = (n) * (n + 1)/2;
        int arrSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            arrSum += arr[i];
        }
        int misNum = num - arrSum;
        System.out.print("The missing number is : " + misNum);
    }
}

Q. Move all zeros to the end.

Solution: To move all zeros to the end,
I first initialize an index variable that keeps track of where the next non-zero element should go. 
Then I iterate through the array once and whenever I find a non-zero value,
I place it at the current index and increase the index by one. This collects all non-zero elements at the beginning of the array in the same order.
After that, for the remaining positions from the current index to the end of the array, I run a while loop and fill all of them with zero. 
This gives me the final array where all non-zero elements come first and all zeros are moved to the end.

Code:
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = {1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 6};
        int index = 0;
        
        for ( int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
            if (arr[i] != 0) {
            arr[index] = arr[i];
            index++;
            }
        }
        
        while (index < arr.length){
            arr[index] = 0;
            index++;
        }
        
        for ( int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
            System.out.print( arr[i] + " ");
        }
     
    }
}

Q. Sort 0s, 1s, 2s (Dutch National Flag Problem).

Solution: To sort  0s, 1s, 2s 

Code:
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = {1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0};
        int low = 0;
        int mid = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;
         
        while (mid <= high){
            
            if (arr[mid] == 0) {
                
                int temp = arr[low];
                arr[low] = arr[mid];
                arr[mid] = temp;
                
                mid++;
                low++;
                
            } else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
                
            } else {
                
                int temp = arr[high];
                arr[high] = arr[mid];
                arr[mid] = temp;
                high--;
                
            }
        }
        
        for ( int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
            System.out.print( arr[i] + " ");
        }
     
    }
}

Q. Maximum subarray sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)

Solution: To find the maximum subarray sum,
we keep adding the numbers as we go through the array. If the total becomes the highest so far,
we consider it as our answer. But if the total turns negative, we stop and start again from the next number,
because a negative total will only reduce the sum of any new subarray.

Code: 
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = {-1, 5, -3, 7, -1};
        
        int currSum = 0;
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            currSum+= arr[i];
            
            if (currSum > maxSum) {
               maxSum = currSum;
            }
            
            if (currSum < 0) {
                currSum = 0;
            }
            
        }
        System.out.print("The max subarray sum : " + maxSum);
     
    }
}
